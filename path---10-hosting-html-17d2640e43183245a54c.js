There is a fee for your domain each year. The cost depends on the company that you use. It might be as low as free or as high as $15 a year. Most are $7 to $10 a year. All this does is give you a domain name, but does not give you hosting.</p>\n<p>You will need to find a company that you are comfortable with and that you don't mind giving them money. I would say go with a company that you know or have heard of. Ask around and see what other people have used. They will tell you if the company was easy to work with. Be aware that there are a lot of companies out there so when you search many will be paid advertisements.</p>\n<p>The steps to getting your own domain.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find a website to use.</li>\n<li>Search to see if the domain that you want is still available.</li>\n<li>If it is you can select it and finish the transaction. You will have to pay for it each year.</li>\n<li>If not they will give you suggestions like a .net or .org</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this point you only have a domain name but not a full website.</p>\n<h2>Hosting</h2>\n<p>Once you have your domain name you will also need to get hosting. This is a server that will store your website. There is also a cost for hosting. Often it will be a monthly cost ranging from $1 to $20 but most will be around $5 a month. Some companies will both sell you the domain and provide hosting this is a nice option. You do not need to use the same company of both.</p>\n<p>Finding the right hosting option can be a little tricky. Its always a good idea to work with a company that you are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>There are many different options with it comes to hosting. I would suggest that you get the cheapest hosting option. It will be more than you will ever need. Keep in mind that most sites are only a few hundred megabits of data and the hosts are giving you gigs of space.</p>\n<p>They can do this because they know that you will never uses all that space. Also you will share that space with many other site.</p>\n<p>Bandwidth is the amount of data transfer that you get. Each time some goes to you site and views a file and reduces that number. Unless you are getting like a million view a month it should not be an issue. If you exceed that amount the site will be shut down until the next month. Most hosts will work with you so that you do not have this happen.\nSome key things to look for are.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enough space but not too much. Don't want to over pay for something you may never use.</li>\n<li>Enough Bandwidth - most likely not an issue but be aware.</li>\n<li>Unix hoisting (never go with the windows option)</li>\n<li>PHP support</li>\n<li>MySql support</li>\n<li>A company that you trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don't be fooled with all the free stuff they are giving you. Everyone gives basically the same stuff.</p>\n<h2>Control Panels</h2>\n<p>Most hosting site will give you some web control panel that will allow you to change some simple settings on the site. As you get more comfortable you can do lots of cool things. Each hosts control panel will be a little different.</p>\n<p>Be sure to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find a company that will give you the level of support you need. Sometimes you may pay a bit more but it will be worth it when you have a question or need help.</li>\n<li>Read reviews of the host from many different sources. Ask your friends how they use. Call the support number and ask question.</li>\n<li>Remember that you do not have to host with the same company that you got your domain from but it might be a good idea. One bill is always better than two.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Getting the files to your site</h2>\n<p>Once you are all set up you will need to move your files to the external server. This is done with an FTP program. When you get your hosting setup they will give you a user and password for the site.</p>\n<p>There are many out there but they have many of the same features.</p>\n<p>Logging in. You will need your domain name, user name and password.</p>\n<p>Once in there will be many folder that show up. You will look for a folder like public_html or www or website. The host will give you the correct name. Navigate into that folder. This where all your web files will live. To get the files there are you need to do is select the files and put them there. This will copy the files from your local computer to the server and allow others to view them.</p>\n<p>Remember that the first file that is severed up will always server up is index.html. Make sure you at least have that in your root folder (public_html)</p>",frontmatter:{lesson:"Setting up your own website",title:"Lesson 10",lessonId:10,downloads:null}},allMarkdownRemark:{edges:[{node:{id:"/Users/dhahn/dev/html-class-g/src/pages/10/hosting.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{title:"Lesson 10",lesson:"Setting up your own website"},fields:{slug:"/10/hosting.html"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/dhahn/dev/html-class-g/src/pages/10/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{title:"Lesson 10",lesson:"Understanding the Index.html"},fields:{slug:"/10/index.html"}}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"/10/hosting.html",title:"Lesson 10"}}}});
