Atom is a desktop application built on web technologies; in other words, it is not an online web application. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained. Atom is based on Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell), a framework that enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and io.js, which is also developed by GitHub. It is written in CoffeeScript and Less. It can also be used as an IDE. Atom was released from beta, as version 1.0, on June 25, 2015.
